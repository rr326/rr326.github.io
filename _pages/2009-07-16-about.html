<p>Hi.  My name is Ross. <a href="http://k2company.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Square2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-131" title="RossHeadshot" src="http://k2company.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Square2-300x300.jpg" alt="Ross Headshot" width="100" height="100" /></a></p>
<p>I'm a startup guy, I guess. By rough counting, I think I've worked for about 25 companies over the years. Many have been short consulting engagements, but several have been long term stints. I've been a software engineer, a product manager, a VP of Marketing, a head of Sales, a founder and CEO, and a GetStuffDone consultant.  While every company is different, after awhile, patterns emerge.</p>
<p>In this incarnation of my blog, I'm going to share some of the patterns I've learned. I will not pretend that the insights I share will be original, brilliant, or perfectly articulated. But they'll be mine, and hopefully they will be useful to some. Or at least enjoyable to me to write.</p>
<p>So here goes.</p>
