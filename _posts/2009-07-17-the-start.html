<p>Almost 4 years ago I quit my job to start a company. I had no idea what I was going to do, but I was resolved to create something.</p>
<p>It took about 3 months to get to a starting idea, and another 3 months to get the company off the ground. The idea, which became InsideCrowd, was to create a way for friends to share advice. It was one of the many attempts to go after the "social search" space (before there was even such a space, that is). We spent three years working on it, built a great product, attacked the market from many different angles, and then ultimately had to shut it down.  We simply couldn't get the friend-based growth we needed, nor could we find away around this requirement. Bummer.</p>
<p>But life goes on.  I moved to Seattle, met a ton of great people, dabbled in a few different spaces, sought aggressively to find the person with the idea (rather than the idea itself), and did some consulting work.  With a little luck, I'd have found something. But the luck wasn't there.</p>
<p>Recently, however, my creative juices have started to flow again.  And whereas before I dabbled, this time I'm committing.</p>
<p>So there you go. I'm starting a company. I don't know what it will be, who it will serve, what problem it will solve, or how I will go about it. But I'll solve all of those and make it happen.</p>
<p>Oh. One more thing. This time it's going to be successful.</p>
