<p><a title="Toolbox for learning machine learning and data science" href="http://k2company.com/blog/2012/09/06/toolbox-for-learning-machine-learning-and-data-science/">My last post</a> got posted to <a title="Tools to get started in machine learning (k2company.com)" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4485230" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> yesterday and it spent the day on the home page. As an obscure, no-follower blogger, I'm not used to any real traction, so I found the results pretty interesting. Here they are.</p>
<p>Posting to Hacker News - I tried to post directly, but I've only read HN and never posted / upvoted, so apparently my Karma wasn't high enough. My post got rejected. A friend was kind enough to post for me. (Thanks Nathan.)</p>
<p>It was posted at 10:30 am. Unfortunately my Google Analytics code was broken for 4.5 hours (after a Wordpress upgrade). So my stats are partial.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Making some simple guesses as to missing data, I'd say I got over 5,000 page views - on a blog whose previous max was under 20. Interestingly, people seemed to really read it, with average time on page for the post at 4:34.</p>
<p>Just as interesting to me is what did NOT happen - very few people clicked to anything else on my blog:</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_299" align="alignnone" width="579"]<a href="http://k2company.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/GAResults03.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-299 " title="Page Views by page" src="http://k2company.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/GAResults03.jpg" alt="Page Views by page" width="579" height="473" /></a> Page Views by Page[/caption]</p>
<p>I guess this makes sense - my post was basically a resource of pointers to tools. You didn't need to really trust me to get value from it, so there wasn't a lot of need to click on my About page. Also, since it wasn't an opinion piece, people didn't seem compelled to see what else I've written.</p>
<p>I also got 55 retweets, seeded by two friends and two Hacker News tweets (and the Hacker News community).</p>
<p>So, in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hacker News main page all day (starting at 10:30 am PT)</li>
<li>86 upvotes ; 34 comments</li>
<li>5,000 page views; 4 min time per page</li>
<li>Very little spillover to the rest of my blog</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>I'd say the "success", for what it was, was because it was on target for the HN community; was a good, practical set of resources, on a topic of current interest; and was written well, simply, and non-obnoxiously.</div>
<div></div>
