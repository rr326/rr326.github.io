<p>I'm restarting my blogging after about a year and a half off. I don't know how long I'll keep at this blogging this time. As long as I find it valuable, I guess.</p>
<p>Last time I focused on some research I did in GPGPU. (Very cool stuff.)</p>
<p>This time I'm going to focus more on the operational side of starting and growing a company. I just finished working with <a title="Atlas Accelerator" href="http://atlasaccelerator.com/" target="_blank">Atlas Accelerator</a> where I had the opportunity to work with 15 startups and to see dozens more. While all startups are different, there are certainly many common themes and challenges. My plan is to focus on those.</p>
<p>The posts prior to this one centered on GPGPU. They are completely different content  than what will follow and rightfully should be archived away.  But my Wordpress skills are mediocre, so I’ll just leave them.</p>
