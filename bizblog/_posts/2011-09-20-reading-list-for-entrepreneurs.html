<p>This may be the most valuable post I write. And while I can't claim this list is sufficient, it certainly is necessary. If you haven't read everything on this list, get on it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product / Market Fit</strong>
<ul>
<li>The most important thing and a really well written article – ALL startups should follow this: <a title="Product Market Fit" href="http://pmarca-archive.posterous.com/the-pmarca-guide-to-startups-part-4-the-only" target="_blank">Product / Market Fit</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Go To Market Strategy for Startups </strong></li>
<ul>
<li>This is like "Four Steps" (below) but shorter (and written by me - so it's awesome).</li>
<li><a href="/bizblog/2011/06/08/go-to-market-strategy-for-startups-the-market-phase-model/">Part 1 - Market Phase Model</a>, <a href="/bizblog/2011/06/08/go-to-market-strategy-for-startups-market-exploration/">Part 2 - Market Exploration</a>, <a href="/bizblog/2011/06/08/go-to-market-strategy-for-startups-market-investigation/">Part 3 - Market Investigation</a></li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Four Steps to the Epiphany</strong>
<ul>
<li><a title="Four Steps to the Epiphany Intro" href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/e145/cgi-bin/winter/drupal/upload/handouts/Four_Steps.pdf" target="_blank">PDF Intro</a> – I think you can get most of the benefit from this first chapter.</li>
<li>Full book – I, quite frankly, never made it through the entire book. For some reason I didn’t like it that much and felt most of the benefit was in the intro. But perhaps I’m missing something. <a href="http://amzn.to/1m4R1S">http://amzn.to/1m4R1S</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Crossing the Chasm</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is THE bible of high tech marketing. Steven Blank of Four Steps would say this is mostly irrelevant since this only comes after customer discovery, but I think he’s non-trivially wrong. This is the book. <a href="http://amzn.to/9YPB3n">http://amzn.to/9YPB3n</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Innovator’s Dilemma</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is right after Crossing the Chasm with respect to marketing strategy books. Love it. <a href="http://amzn.to/ahEhhN">http://amzn.to/ahEhhN</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Sales Learning Curve</strong>
<ul>
<li>HBS article. Very good article on how to think about sales. Genesis of the concept of the Renaissance Rep. <a title="Sales Learning Curve" href="http://www.signallake.com/innovation/SalesLearningCurve.pdf" target="_blank">Link</a>.</li>
<li>Obviously this isn't essential if you are building a online-only or consumer startup.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note - Crossing the Chasm and The Innovator's Dilemma are two-thirds of the holy trinity of high tech strategy books. I'm still looking for the third.</p>
