                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s.</p>

                <p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
                    essentially unchanged.</p>

                <p>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
                    Ipsum.</p>

            <p>This blog focuses on random business things I've felt like sharing. It's mostly an archive (but
                there is some good stuff is in here, if I do say so myself).</p>
